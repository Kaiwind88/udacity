# Artificial Intelligence for Robotics

I completed this course in Oct, 2016 as part of my MLND Capstone project - Plot and Navigate a Virtual Maze.


## About this Course

Learn how to program all the major systems of a robotic car from the leader of Google and Stanford's autonomous driving teams. This class will teach you basic methods in Artificial Intelligence, including: probabilistic inference, planning and search, localization, tracking and control, all with a focus on robotics. Extensive programming examples and assignments will apply these methods in the context of building self-driving cars.

The updated course includes a final project, where you must chase a runaway robot that is trying to escape!
