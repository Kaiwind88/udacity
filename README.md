## About Udacity

Udacity is building an online university, "by Silicon Valley", that: 

- teaches the skills that industry employers need today
- delivers credentials endorsed by employers
- educates at a fraction of the cost of traditional schools

With industry giants—Google, AT&T, Facebook, Salesforce, Cloudera, etc.—we offer Nanodegree programs and credentials, designed so professionals become Web Developers, Data Analysts, Mobile Developers, etc. Our students acquire real skills through a series of online courses and hands-on projects.
