## Technical Interview Practice

For this project, you will be given five technical interviewing questions on a variety of topics discussed in the technical interviewing course. You should write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices. A qualified reviewer will look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might be awesome or lackingâ€”is your solution the most efficient one possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is your code elegant and easy to read?
