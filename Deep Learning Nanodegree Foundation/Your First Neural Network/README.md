# Your First Neural Network

In this project, we will build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, we will have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
