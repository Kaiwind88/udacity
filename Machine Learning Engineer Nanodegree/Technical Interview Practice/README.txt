Change log:

1. I have added explanation for space complexity for all my implementations in explanations.txt. This was missing before.
2. I have corrected time complexity for Answer 1
3. Please provide hint for Question 4 or accept my new proposed solution.

"""
QUESTION 4: Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree. 
"""
# Additional note for reviewer: You asked me to implement this solution without building BST. From the problem
description there seems to be some emphasis on building BST. Regardless, as an alternative solution, I'm thinking
I could build a vector of path from root->n1 and another vector of path from root->n2. Then I can compare the two
vectors to find the common ancestor of the nodes n1 and n2. If my thought process is off, please provide a hint. 
Otherwise, please accept my proposed solution.
