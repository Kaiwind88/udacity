# AlexNet Feature Extraction

This lab guides you through using AlexNet and TensorFlow to build a feature extraction network.

Download the [training data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580a829f_train/train.p) and [AlexNet weights](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580d880c_bvlc-alexnet/bvlc-alexnet.npy). 

run `python imagenet_inference.py`

run `python traffic_sign_inference_solution.py`

run `python feature_extraction_solution.py` 

run `python train_feature_extraction_solution.py`

Congratulations! You've trained AlexNet as a feature extractor!
