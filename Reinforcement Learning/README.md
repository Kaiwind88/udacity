# Reinforcement Learning

I'm currently taking this course in Nov, 2016 as part of my SDND.

I'll checkin my solutions of homework and final project once the course changes its material.

## About this Course

You should take this course if you have an interest in machine learning and the desire to engage with it from a theoretical perspective. Through a combination of classic papers and more recent work, you will explore automated decision-making from a computer-science perspective. You will examine efficient algorithms, where they exist, for single-agent and multi-agent planning as well as approaches to learning near-optimal decisions from experience. At the end of the course, you will replicate a result from a published paper in reinforcement learning.
